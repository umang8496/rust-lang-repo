## What is Rust ?

Rust is a high-performance, statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language.  
With the main focus on safety and performance.  
This language helps developers create robust and secure applications.  
Compared to C/C++, which struggles with memory errors and developing concurrent programs, Rust has already solved these problems.  
The open source Rust community describes the language as fast, reliable and productive.  

Rust code was originally developed by software developer Graydon Hoare while working at Mozilla Research in 2006
And since 2021, it has been maintained by the Rust Foundation.  

The top benefit of Rust programming language is its adept memory management.  
Rust handles the concept differently in that it doesn’t use a garbage collector as other programming languages do.  
Instead, Rust uses a borrow checker to track variable scope and object lifetime while simultaneously administering high-quality memory safety and stopping concurrent data races.  

The benefits of Rust programming don’t stop at memory management.  
It’s fast and reliable for creating web apps and creating cross-platform applications, and it can integrate with pre-existing code.

One of the other major benefits of Rust programming language is that it is well-suited for projects that demand extremely high performance.  
Its ability to process large amounts of data and CPU-intensive operations makes it a strong competitor in the developer space.
